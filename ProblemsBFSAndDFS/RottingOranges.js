// You are given an m x n grid where each cell can have one of three values:

// 0 representing an empty cell,
// 1 representing a fresh orange, or
// 2 representing a rotten orange.
// Every minute, if a Fresh Orange is adjacent to a Rotten Orange in 4-direction ( upward, downwards, right, and left ) it becomes Rotten.

// Return the minimum number of minutes required such that none of the cells has a Fresh Orange. If itâ€™s not possible, return -1.

// Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange. If this is impossible, return -1.

// Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]
// Output: 4
// Example 2:

// Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]]
// Output: -1
// Explanation: The orange in the bottom left corner (row 2, column 0) is never rotten, because rotting only happens 4-directionally.
// Example 3:

// Input: grid = [[0,2]]
// Output: 0
// Explanation: Since there are already no fresh oranges at minute 0, the answer is just 0.
